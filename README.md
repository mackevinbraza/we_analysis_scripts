# we_analysis_scripts

Some of the scripts have been originally prepared by Terra Sztain,
Anthony Bogetti, John Russo, and others from Prof. Lillian
Chong's group (University of Pittsburgh) and have went through
several modifications.

- simtime_walltime.py: prints out the total simulation time and
walltime for the WE simulation of interest using west.h5
- w_pdist.sh: plots average free energy landscape and evolution
of progress coordinate values - useful to keep track of progress
of your currently running WE simulation (useful tip: periodically
make copies of west.h5 in case the main one gets ruined)
